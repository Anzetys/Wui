Make a ticket and explain your point on 1 single resumed message, take a breath and cool down before typing, arguing with staff will only make your case worse and you will very likely banned regardless of your rank/purchases.\n\nFinal Word: ADMINS have final say in all matters, even if not covered under the rules if they find actions of players are detrimental to the community, action taken outside the rules may be taken to prevent disruption. Therefore, arguing with an Admin will only get you Banned or Muted.\n\nIF STAFF SAYS SOMETHING LISTEN TO THEM. FAILING TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS WILL GIVE YOU A FREE BAN\n\nDO NOT ENFORCE RULES IF YOU ARE NOT STAFF. DO NOT BLOCK CAVES OR TELL PEOPLE TO MOVE IF YOU ARE NOT STAFF. THIS WILL GRANT YOU A FREE BAN ASWELL",
